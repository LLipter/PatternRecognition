# Skewness

Skewness is asymmetry in a statistical distribution, in which the curve appears distorted or skewed either to the left or to the right. Skewness can be quantified to define the extent to which a distribution differs from a normal distribution.

### Formula

~~~python
# function to compute skewness of given data
def skewness(data):
    mu =  np.mean(data)
    sigma = np.std(data)
    skew = (data - mu) / sigma
    skew = skew ** 3
    skew = np.sum(skew) / len(data)
    return skew

### Symmetric Distribution

Data presented above is normally distributed generated by the following codes.

~~~python
>>> data = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=100000)
~~~

### Positive Skew

The right tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left of the figure. The distribution is said to be right-skewed, right-tailed, or skewed to the right, despite the fact that the curve itself appears to be skewed or leaning to the left; right instead refers to the right tail being drawn out and, often, the mean being skewed to the right of a typical center of the data. A right-skewed distribution usually appears as a left-leaning curve

Data presented above is positively skewed, which is a superposition of two independent normal distribution generated by the following codes.

~~~python
>>> data = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=10000)
>>> data = np.append(data, np.random.normal(-3,1,90000))
~~~


### Negative Skew

The left tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right of the figure. The distribution is said to be left-skewed, left-tailed, or skewed to the left, despite the fact that the curve itself appears to be skewed or leaning to the right; left instead refers to the left tail being drawn out and, often, the mean being skewed to the left of a typical center of the data. A left-skewed distribution usually appears as a right-leaning curve.

Data presented above is negative skewed, which is a superposition of two independent normal distribution generated by the following codes.

~~~python
>>> data = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=10000)
>>> data = np.append(data, np.random.normal(3,1,90000))

# Boxplot

Brach 1 is basically symmetric distributed, ranging from $40 to $155 approximately. However, the two black points on the top may represent some outliers and need to be detected or removed before further research. Branch 2 is positively skewed and branch 3 is negatively skewed. Branch 4 is also symmetric   distributed and is more evenly distributed than branch 1. Also, its range is smaller than branch 1.
